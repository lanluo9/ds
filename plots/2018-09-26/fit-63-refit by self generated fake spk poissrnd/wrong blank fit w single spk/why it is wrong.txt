what was supposed to happen:
i fitted NIM w white noise dataset 007
used NIM to generate fake poisson spk
refit NIM w fake data
check model changes & perf

what happened instead:
i fitted NIM w white noise dataset 007
used NIM to generate fake poisson spk
fit an empty NIM w fake data, which might have gone wrong too bc i now suspect i only used spk(1) instead of spk(:,1)
NIM model looks like a horror movie
